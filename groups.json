            organization, we seek to promote social innovation. \
            As an event, we will bring together community leaders, \
            designers, developers, and other concerned citizens \
            to create solutions that will help make a lasting \
            impact in Columbus."

            of the generosity of our many volunteers. Volunteers \
            staff our food pantry Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. \
            until 2 p.m. They register clients, help them shop in \
            the Choice Food Pantry, assist with stocking shelves, \
            help unload delivery trucks, and perform other duties as needed.\
            To keep our facility welcoming to our neighbors, we also look for \
            volunteers to help with housekeeping projects and light facility \
            maintenance. Volunteers step up to make special projects \
            possible several times each year by assisting with Holiday \
            Food Boxes preparation and distribution. During the holiday \
            season, we provide toys to our neighbors through project \
            Kringle. Volunteers register neighbors and then help families \
            select toys and other special items for their children."
